# 3-Piece Tic Tac Toe Rules:
- The game is played on a 3×3 grid.
- Each player can only have 3 pieces on the board at once.
- When a player already has 3 pieces and places another, their oldest piece disappears.
- You can also place your next piece on the flashing cell (the one that will disappear next).
- The goal remains the same: get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
